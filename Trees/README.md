<h2 align="center">Tree</h2>
<strong>A tree is a non-linear data structure. It has parent and child nodes. It's a type of linked list but with more ways to reach down from top to bottom.

Usage: -

* Our webpages are created by the DOM or document object model and this is a tree data structure.
* Back in the day, when the machine learning was not invented, the tree data structure was used to pick predicting the better outcome in the chase game.
* The comments we do in a facebook post and reply in the comments are the example of trees.
* Abstract syntax tree. This is how usually the programs run. The code is broken down to the abstract syntax tree by the machine.

<div>
<h2 align="center">Binary Tree</h2>
<strong>A binary tree can have 0-2 children. There we can have perfect binary tree and full binary tree. In the perfect one, all the nodes are filled up from top to bottom. 

Rules: -

* The number of total nodes on each level doubles as we move down the tree.  
* The number of nodes at the bottom level is equal to the number of nodes to the upper levels-1.
* In a binary search tree, we have to use divide and conquer method and go throgh a subset to find the element.
