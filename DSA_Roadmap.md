# 2-Month DSA Interview Prep Roadmap for AI/ML Engineers

This roadmap is designed to take you from fundamentals to interview-ready in 8 weeks, focusing on pattern recognition and a systematic approach to problem-solving.

## The Mindset: Before You Begin

The goal isn't just to get the right answer, but to showcase a structured, logical thinking process. The interview is a collaborative session to see *how* you think.

*   **Verbalize Everything:** Think out loud. Explain your initial thoughts, why you're choosing a particular data structure, what the trade-offs are, and what edge cases you're considering.
*   **Brute-Force is Your Friend:** It's often better to start with a simple, even inefficient, solution that works. This shows you can solve the problem. Then, you can say, "This works, but we can optimize it. The bottleneck here is X, so we can improve it by using Y."
*   **Data Structures are the Tools:** The core of DSA is knowing which tool (data structure) to use for the job. Always ask yourself: "What is the data, and how do I need to access it? Do I need fast lookups? Do I need ordering? Do I need the min/max element quickly?" This will guide your choice.

## The Process: How to Tackle Any Problem

Follow this framework for every single problem you practice to build a strong habit.

1.  **Understand & Clarify (2-5 minutes):**
    *   Repeat the question back in your own words to confirm understanding.
    *   Ask clarifying questions about inputs: What's the range of values? Can the array be empty? Are there duplicates? Are there negative numbers? What are the constraints on N?
    *   Manually walk through a small example provided or create one yourself. This confirms you understand the goal. `Input: [1, 2, 3], Target: 4 -> Output: ?`

2.  **Brainstorm & Strategize (5-7 minutes):**
    *   Start with the brute-force approach. What's the most straightforward, naive way to solve this? Verbalize its time and space complexity (e.g., "We could use a nested loop, which would be O(n^2)").
    *   Look for patterns (covered in the roadmap below). Does this look like a "sliding window" problem? A "two-pointer" problem? A graph traversal?
    *   Choose a data structure that optimizes your approach. "A nested loop is slow because we're repeatedly searching for a value. A hash map gives us O(1) lookups, so maybe we can use that to improve our time complexity."

3.  **Implement the Code (15-20 minutes):**
    *   Write clean, readable code. Use meaningful variable names (`left_pointer` instead of `i`).
    *   Talk through your code as you write it. "First, I'll initialize a dictionary to store the values we've seen. Then, I'll loop through the array..."

4.  **Test & Verify (3-5 minutes):**
    *   Test your code with the example you used earlier.
    *   Crucially, test with **edge cases**: empty arrays, single-element arrays, very large numbers, arrays with all duplicates, etc.

### What to Do When You're Stuck vs. When You Succeed

*   **If you get stuck (after ~25-30 minutes):**
    1.  **Don't panic.** Take a deep breath and re-read the problem.
    2.  Try a different, even smaller, example.
    3.  Look for a **hint**, not the full solution.
    4.  If still stuck, look at the solution. **This is not failure, it's a learning opportunity.**
    5.  **Crucial Step:** Don't just read and move on. Understand the logic deeply. Then, close the solution and try to code it yourself from scratch.
    6.  Schedule that same problem for a re-do in 2-3 days.

*   **If you solve it:**
    1.  **Analyze Complexity:** What is the time and space complexity of your solution? Can you articulate why?
    2.  **Optimize:** Is this the *best* possible solution? Can you reduce the time or space complexity?
    3.  **Review Other Solutions:** Look at the discussion board or official solutions. You will often find clever alternative approaches or ways to write your code more cleanly.
    4.  **Categorize It:** What pattern did this problem use? (e.g., "This was a classic Sliding Window problem"). Add it to your review log.

## The 8-Week Problem-Solving Roadmap

**Primary Platform:** LeetCode

### **Week 0: The Foundation (Don't Skip This!)**

*   **Goal:** Solidify language fundamentals and complexity analysis.
*   **Topics:**
    *   **Language Proficiency (Python Recommended):** Master your chosen language's syntax for lists/arrays, dictionaries/hash maps, sets, strings, and loops.
    *   **Big O Notation:** Master Time Complexity and Space Complexity. You MUST be able to analyze any solution you write. Learn the difference between O(1), O(log n), O(n), O(n log n), O(n^2), and O(2^n).
*   **Practice:** Focus on understanding the concepts rather than solving many problems.

### **Part 1: Core Patterns (Weeks 1-4)**

#### **Week 5: Graphs**
*   **Concept:** The most versatile data structure. Many problems can be modeled as a graph.
*   **Patterns to Learn:**
    *   **Graph Traversals (BFS & DFS):** The core of all graph problems. Use BFS for shortest path in unweighted graphs, DFS for connectivity and exploration. *Keywords: grid, matrix, islands, connected components, shortest path.*
        *   *Examples: Number of Islands, Clone Graph.*
    *   **Topological Sort:** For problems with dependencies or ordering. *Keywords: dependencies, course, schedule, order.*
        *   *Examples: Course Schedule, Alien Dictionary.*
*   **Practice:** ~10-15 problems. Graph problems are often harder; focus on quality over quantity.

#### **Week 6: Dynamic Programming (DP)**
*   **Concept:** Breaking down a complex problem into simpler, overlapping sub-problems.
*   **Patterns to Learn:**
    *   **1D DP:** The logic often involves a decision at each step based on previous results. *Keywords: max/min, count ways, can I reach the end.*

    *   **Memoization vs. Tabulation:** Understand both the top-down (recursive with cache) and bottom-up (iterative with table) approaches.
*   **Practice:** Be patient. DP is hard. Start with 5-10 classic problems and truly understand them.

#### **Week 7: Review & Advanced Concepts**
*   **Concept:** Solidify knowledge and touch on less common but important topics.
*   **Topics:**
    *   **Backtracking:** A recursive technique for finding all solutions by exploring all potential paths. *Keywords: all combinations, all permutations, all subsets, N-Queens.*
        *   *Examples: Subsets, Combination Sum, Permutations.*
    *   **Spaced Repetition:** Go back and re-solve problems you found difficult from Weeks 1-4. Use a spreadsheet to track problems: [Problem Name, Pattern, Date Solved, Difficulty, Re-do Date].
    *   **Binary Search on Answer:** For problems where you can guess an answer and validate it. *Keywords: minimize the maximum, maximize the minimum.*
        *   *Examples: Split Array Largest Sum, Capacity To Ship Packages Within D Days.*

#### **Week 8: Mock Interviews & Final Polish**
*   **Goal:** Simulate the real interview environment. This is the most important step.
*   **Actions:**
    *   **Do Mock Interviews:** Use platforms like Pramp, interviewing.io, or practice with peers. Get used to coding and talking under pressure. Aim for 3-5 mocks.
    *   **Company-Specific Practice:** Use LeetCode Premium to filter for problems frequently asked by your target companies.
    *   **Refine Your Story:** Prepare answers for behavioral questions ("Tell me about a challenging project," "Why this company?").
    *   **Review Your Log:** Quickly review the patterns and key problems you've logged in your spreadsheet.

### **Special Considerations for AI/ML Roles**

While DSA is the foundation, be prepared for questions that bridge the gap to your specialization.

*   **Probability & Statistics:** Basic concepts like Bayes' theorem, conditional probability, distributions.
*   **Machine Learning Concepts:** Be prepared to explain how algorithms like K-Means, Logistic Regression, or Gradient Boosting work on a whiteboard.
*   **ML System Design:** Questions like "How would you design a recommendation system for YouTube?" or "How would you build a spam detection filter?". It's good to watch a few videos on this topic to understand the general framework.
