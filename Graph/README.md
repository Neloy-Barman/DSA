<h1 align='center'>Graph</h1>

<strong>Graphs are one of the most useful data structures in computer science when it comes to modeling real life. A graph is simply a set of values that are related in a pair wise fashion. Each item is called a node or a vertex. Nodes are then connected with edges. We can use graphs to represent friendships or family trees or networks or the worldwide web or roads to represent one city to another. Facebook uses it for their social network, amazon uses it for the recommendation engines and google maps for determining the shortest path.

Types of Graphs: - 
</strong>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Directed and Undirected graph: - </strong>These types of graphs are useful for traffic flow or a kind of system in which movement is not bidirectional. In directed graphs, we can move to a particular direction that’s directed whereas in undirected, we can move to any direction. In facebook, when I’m connected to a friend, a friend is also connected to me, that’s undirected. Twitter is more directed, If I follow someone, then others don’t follow automatically.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Weighted and unweighted graph: - </strong>In weighted graphs, the edges are associated with values. These are used in google maps to find the shortest path to reach somewhere. In unweighted graphs the edges are not associated with values. Here starting from the initial point, we can reach again there. 
    </li>
    <li><strong>Cyclic or Acyclic graphs: - </strong>When we have vertices connected in a circular fashion, then we call it a cycle. Cyclic graphs are most common in weighted graphs, most of the time we get a way back. 
    </li>
</ul>

<strong>Some useful informations: - </strong>
<ul>
    <li>Search for The Opte Project to find the best example of a graph. This shows us how the IP addresses are connected to each other to create the internet.</li>
    <li>Directed Acyclic Graph is called DAG.</li>
    <li>There is a tool called neo4j that allows us to create really fast graph databases.</li>
</ul>

<strong>Graph Pros and Cons: - </strong>

<ul>
    <li>When it comes to relationships, graphs are pretty useful because some data just needs to be in a graph form. There is no other way around it. But there are algorithms that allows us to perform operations such as finding the shortest path or traversing a graph.</li>
    <li>Graphs can become complicated when it comes to performance and big-O, so scaling is very hard. You need a lot of resources and engineering power to make sure that we build data strucctures that scale well.</li>
