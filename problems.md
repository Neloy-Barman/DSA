# The Ultimate 8-Week Daily DSA Syllabus

## Core Principles for Every Session

*   **Timeboxing:** Stick to the recommended times. If you can't solve it, that's okay! The goal is to learn efficiently, not to get stuck for hours.
*   **The Process:** For EVERY problem, follow the 4-step process:
    1.  **Understand & Clarify** (2-5 mins)
    2.  **Brainstorm & Strategize** (5-7 mins)
    3.  **Implement Code** (15-20 mins)
    4.  **Test & Verify** (3-5 mins)
*   **Review is Key:** If you solve a problem, spend 10-15 minutes reviewing alternative solutions. If you don't solve it, spend 20-25 minutes deeply understanding the official solution, then **try to re-code it from scratch without looking**.

### **Week 0: The Foundation**

*Goal: Set up the fundamentals. Don't skip this.*

*   **Day 1-3: Language Proficiency.** Ensure you are fluent in your chosen language's core data structures: arrays/lists, hashmaps/dictionaries, and sets. Practice creating, adding to, removing from, and iterating over them.
*   **Day 4-7: Big O Notation.** Watch videos and read articles on Time and Space Complexity. Your goal is to be able to look at a piece of code with nested loops, for example, and confidently say why it's O(n^2). Analyze the complexity of every problem you solve going forward.
