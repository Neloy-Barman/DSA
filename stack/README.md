<h2 align="center">Stack</h2>
<strong>Stack is a linear data structure. It keeps data in a way that one data comes and the other ones are placed or stacked on top of that. This process keeps going. We can only access data from the top of that and can’t touch anything from the bottom of that. It’s called LIFO (Last in First out). 

Usage: -

* Stacks are very important for the language specific search engines.
* When the function gets called, the LIFO manner is maintained to keep track and pop.
* In browser history, when we go from one to another and backwards, it's maintained using stacks.
* In text editor, when we do or undo something, this is kept in stack.
